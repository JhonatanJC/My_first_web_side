								<h1>  ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</h1>
                                                                <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned with building smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. AI is an interdisciplinary science with multiple approaches, but advancements in machine learning and deep learning are creating a paradigm shift in virtually every sector of the tech industry. </p> <img src = 'https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x2/2000/20200420164236-InteligenciaArtificial.jpeg?width=700&crop=2:1' >

                                                                <h3>How Artificial Intelligence work?</h3>
                                                                <p>Artificial intelligence is based on the principle that human intelligence can be defined in a way that a machine can easily mimic it and execute tasks, from the most simple to those that are even more complex. The goals of artificial intelligence include learning, reasoning, and perception.

As technology advances, previous benchmarks that defined artificial intelligence become outdated. For example, machines that calculate basic functions or recognize ext through optical character recognition are no longer considered to embody artificial intelligence, since this function is now taken for granted as an inherent computer function.

AI is continuously evolving to benefit many different industries. Machines are wired using a cross-disciplinary approach based on mathematics, computer science, linguistics, psychology, and more.  </p> </article</p>

								<h2> Categorization of Artificial Intelligence </h2>
                                                                <h3>Narrow AI</h3>
                                                                <p>Narrow AI is all around us and is easily the most successful realization of artificial intelligence to date. With its focus on performing specific tasks, Narrow AI has experienced numerous breakthroughs in the last decade that have had "significant societal benefits and have contributed to the economic vitality of the nation," according to "Preparing for the Future of Artificial Intelligence," a 2016 report released by the Obama Administration.

Much of Narrow AI is powered by breakthroughs in machine learning and deep learning. Understanding the difference between artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning can be confusing. Machine learning consists of both supervised learning (using labeled data sets) and unsupervised learning (using unlabeled data sets). Deep learning is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through a biologically-inspired neural network architecture. The neural networks contain a number of hidden layers through which the data is processed, allowing the machine to go "deep" in its learning, making connections and weighting input for the best results.</p>

								<h3> Artificial General Intelligence </h3>
								<p>The creation of a machine with human-level intelligence that can be applied to any task is the Holy Grail for many AI researchers, but the quest for AGI has been fraught with difficulty. The search for a "universal algorithm for learning and acting in any environment," (Russel and Norvig 27) isn't new, but time hasn't eased the difficulty of essentially creating a machine with a full set of cognitive abilities. AGI has long been the muse of dystopian science fiction, in which super-intelligent robots overrun humanity, but experts agree it's not something we need to worry about anytime soon.</p>

                                                                <p>The application of classical machine learning methods to the study of quantum systems (sometimes called quantum machine learning) is the focus of an emerging area of research in physics. A basic example of this is quantum state tomography, where a quantum state is learned from measurement. Other examples include the learning of Hamiltonians, the learning of quantum phase transitions, and the automatic generation of new quantum experiments. Classical machine learning is effective in processing large amounts of experimental or calculated data to characterize an unknown quantum system, making its application useful in contexts that include quantum information theory, the development of quantum technologies, and the design of computational materials.</p>
